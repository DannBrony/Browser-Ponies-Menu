Browser Ponies Menu Thing
===================

This is a menu thingy (for lack of a better name) that is used as a simpler way to interact with the [Browser Ponies Script](http://panzi.github.com/Browser-Ponies/),<br>
that inserts a fixed menu along with a spawnlist.<br>
Credits for every animation and art go to it's respective owners.<br>
Browser Ponies is a javascript reimplementation of Desktop Ponies made by [_Panzi_](//github.com/Panzi).<br>
(Still a work in progress)
Current Fiddles: 
<br>
[**Menu**](http://jsfiddle.net/Dann/YFRtm/) (With updated spawnlist)<br>
[**Spawnlist**](http://jsfiddle.net/Dann/sBPhP/) (Not updated, current version is in the menu.)

===================
* This is very buggy, and doesn't work on `https://` URLs.
* Also, the spawnlist doesn't fade out.<br>

Drag this to your bookmarks and click it.<br>
Magic happens!<br><br>
